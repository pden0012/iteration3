```

### Deploy to Web Server
1. Deploy the entire `dist/` directory to your web server
2. Ensure image resources are properly placed
3. Make sure your web server serves static files with correct MIME types


### Common Deployment Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: CSS Files Not Loading (MIME Type Error)
**Problem**: CSS files are served with `text/plain` MIME type instead of `text/css`
**Solution**: 
- Configure your web server to serve `.css` files with `text/css` MIME type
- For Apache: Add `AddType text/css .css` to `.htaccess`
- For Nginx: Ensure `text/css` is in the MIME types configuration

#### Issue 2: 404 Errors for JavaScript/CSS Files
**Problem**: Files are not found due to incorrect base path configuration
**Solution**: 
- Make sure `base: '/'` is set correctly in `vite.config.js`
- Ensure all files in `dist/assets/` are uploaded to the server
- Check that file names match exactly (including hash suffixes)

#### Issue 3: White Screen on Load
**Problem**: JavaScript files fail to load or execute
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify all assets are uploaded correctly
- Ensure JavaScript files are served with correct MIME type (`application/javascript`)

#### Issue 4: CORS Proxy Errors in Image Detection
**Problem**: Image detection fails with 403 Forbidden errors from CORS proxy services
**Solution**: 
- The application now uses multiple CORS proxy services as fallback options
- Services include: allorigins.win, corsproxy.io, thingproxy.freeboard.io, and cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com
- If all proxies fail, users will see a friendly error message instead of technical errors
- The system automatically tries each proxy service in sequence until one succeeds

#### Issue 5: Map Data Loading Timeout Errors
**Problem**: "Failed to load map data TimeoutError: signal timed out" when loading tree data
**Solution**: 
- Extended timeout from 15 seconds to 45 seconds for large tree datasets
- Improved retry mechanism with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Enhanced error classification for different HTTP status codes (500, 502, 503, 404)
- Added intelligent error messages with emojis for better user experience
- Added manual retry button for users to retry failed requests
- Enhanced loading indicators with retry attempt information
- Better handling of server errors and network connectivity issues

#### Issue 6: HTTP 502 Bad Gateway Errors
**Problem**: "Error loading tree data: HTTP 502: Please check API server status" when accessing map data
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced proxy server error handling with detailed logging
- Added specific error classification for 502 Bad Gateway errors (ECONNREFUSED, ETIMEDOUT)
- Improved proxy timeout handling (60 seconds for proxy, 45 seconds for client)
- Enhanced error messages to distinguish between different gateway issues
- Automatic retry mechanism for 502 errors with exponential backoff
- Better handling of Render deployment environment proxy issues

#### Issue 7: Render Deployment 502 Errors
**Problem**: 502 Bad Gateway errors when deployed on Render.com
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced proxy middleware error handling for Render environment
- Added detailed logging for proxy connection issues
- Improved timeout configuration for Render's infrastructure
- Better error classification for deployment-specific issues

#### Issue 8: Render Static File Serving and Connection Stability
**Problem**: Vue application not displaying on Render deployment, only showing proxy server JSON response. Multiple connection errors including 400, 502, 504 status codes.
**Solution**: 
- **Static File Serving Fix**:
  - Updated render.yaml to ensure `npm install` runs before build
  - Added dist directory existence checking in server.js
  - Improved static file error handling with detailed logging
  - Created build verification script (check-build.js)
- **Connection Stability Improvements**:
  - Extended proxy timeout from 60s to 90s for large datasets
  - Added proxyTimeout configuration
  - Enhanced error handling for already-sent responses (prevents duplicate response errors)
  - Added support for 400 (Bad Request), 504 (Gateway Timeout), and ENOTFOUND errors
  - Improved retry logic to include 504 timeout errors
  - Better error messages for each status code with user-friendly guidance
- **Result**: Vue application now correctly displays on Render with improved error resilience

#### Issue 9: Enhanced 502 Bad Gateway Error Handling and Server Status Monitoring
**Problem**: Persistent 502 Bad Gateway errors with insufficient error information and no server status visibility.
**Solution**: 
- **Enhanced Proxy Server Error Handling**:
  - Extended proxy timeout from 60s to 90s to match client timeout
  - Added comprehensive error classification for ECONNREFUSED, ETIMEDOUT, ENOTFOUND, ECONNRESET, EPIPE
  - Improved error response format with detailed error information and retryable flags
  - Added connection keep-alive headers and retry options
  - Enhanced logging with emoji indicators for better debugging
- **Client-Side Improvements**:
  - Extended client timeout from 45s to 90s to match proxy server
  - Added server status checking functionality with real-time status display
  - Enhanced error message parsing to show detailed backend error information
  - Added automatic server status checking when errors occur
  - Improved retry mechanism with better user feedback
- **New Features**:
  - Real-time server status indicator (✅ reachable, ❌ unreachable, ⚠️ unknown)
  - Enhanced diagnostic endpoints (/api/diagnose, /api/test-backend)
  - Build and deployment verification script (build-and-deploy.js)
  - Better error messages with emoji indicators for improved UX
- **Result**: Significantly improved error handling, better user feedback, and enhanced debugging capabilities

### Render.com Deployment Notes

#### Step-by-step Render Deployment:

1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repository to Render
2. **Build Settings**:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `dist`
   - Node Version: 18 or latest

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Go to your service's "Environment" tab in Render dashboard
   - Add: `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your Google Maps API key
   - Add: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (optional, defaults to `http://3.106.197.188:8080`)

4. **Deploy**: Click "Manual Deploy" or push to your connected branch

#### Common Render Deployment Issues:

**Issue**: "Error loading tree data" on deployed site
- **Cause**: Backend API server issues or network connectivity
- **Solution**: Ensure backend API server is running and accessible

**Issue**: Blank map or Google Maps errors  
- **Cause**: Missing or invalid Google Maps API key
- **Solution**: Verify `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set in Render environment variables

**Issue**: Network errors in production
- **Cause**: Backend API server issues or firewall blocking
- **Solution**: Ensure backend API server allows external requests

### API Configuration

#### Google Maps API Key
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the "Maps JavaScript API"
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Set up environment variable: `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key`

#### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://3.106.197.188:8080
VITE_APP_PASSWORD=123456
```

**For Render.com deployment**, set these environment variables in your Render dashboard:
- `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Your Google Maps JavaScript API key
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (optional): Backend API URL with protocol

**Important**: Replace `your_google_maps_api_key` with your actual Google Maps API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis)

## Map Performance Optimization

### Tree Data Loading
The map component loads tree data from the backend API server. Due to the large dataset size and current server instability, several optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Extended Timeout**: Increased from 15 to 45 seconds to accommodate large datasets
2. **Smart Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed requests up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. **Progressive Loading**: Shows loading progress and retry attempts to users
4. **Performance Hints**: Suggests zooming in for faster loading when >1000 trees are loaded
5. **Error Classification**: Provides specific error messages for different failure types (500, 503, 404, timeout, network)
6. **Manual Retry**: Users can manually retry failed requests with a dedicated button
7. **Server Status Awareness**: Better handling of backend server issues and maintenance periods

### Current Server Status
**Backend API Server**: `http://3.106.197.188:8080`
- **Status**: Experiencing intermittent connectivity issues
- **Common Issues**: HTTP 500 errors, network timeouts, service unavailability
- **User Experience**: Application provides clear error messages and retry options
- **Recommendation**: Consider implementing a backup data source or caching mechanism

### User Experience Improvements
- **Loading Indicators**: Clear visual feedback during data loading
- **Retry Messages**: Shows retry attempt progress (e.g., "Retrying... (Attempt 1/2)")
- **Success Feedback**: Displays tree count and performance tips for large datasets
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network issues and server errors

### Backend API Configuration
- **Base URL**: `http://3.106.197.188:8080` (production server)
- **Endpoint**: `/map/tree` with zoom level and bounding box parameters
- **Data Format**: JSON with tree coordinates, names, and allergenicity levels
- **Response Size**: Can be 30KB+ for large areas, requiring extended timeouts
